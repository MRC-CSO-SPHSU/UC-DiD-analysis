abstract = {This paper analyzes difference-in-differences setups with a continuous
treatment. We show that treatment effect on the treated-type parameters can be
identified under a generalized parallel trends assumption that is similar to
the binary treatment setup. However, interpreting differences in these
parameters across different values of the treatment can be particularly
challenging due to treatment effect heterogeneity. We discuss alternative,
typically stronger, assumptions that alleviate these challenges. We also
provide a variety of treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting that
parameters associated with popular two-way fixed-effect specifications can be
hard to interpret, even when there are only two time periods. We introduce
alternative estimation strategies that do not suffer from these drawbacks. Our
results also cover cases where (i) there is no available untreated comparison
group and (ii) there are multiple periods and variation in treatment timing,
which are both common in empirical work.},

abstract = {Objectives To understand the impact of the roll-out of Universal Credit (UC) from the perspectives of claimants and staff supporting them in North East England.

Design Qualitative study comprising interviews and focus groups.

Setting Gateshead and Newcastle, two localities in North East England characterised by high levels of socioeconomic deprivation, where the roll-out of UC started in 2017 as a new way to deliver welfare benefits for the UK working age population.

Participants 33 UC claimants with complex needs, disabilities and health conditions and 37 staff from local government, housing, voluntary and community sector organisations.

Results Participants' accounts of the UC claims process and the consequences of managing on UC are reported; UC negatively impacts on material wellbeing, physical and mental health, social and family lives. UC claimants described the digital claims process as complicated, disorientating, impersonal, hostile and demeaning. Claimants reported being pushed into debt, rent arrears, housing insecurity, fuel and food poverty through UC. System failures, indifference and delays in receipt of UC entitlements exacerbated the difficulties of managing on a low income. The threat of punitive sanctions for failing to meet the enhanced conditionality requirements under UC added to claimant's vulnerabilities and distress. Staff reported concerns for claimants and additional pressures on health services, local government and voluntary and community sector organisations as a result of UC.

Conclusions The findings add considerable detail to emerging evidence of the deleterious effects of UC on vulnerable claimants' health and wellbeing. Our evidence suggests that UC is undermining vulnerable claimants' mental health, increasing the risk of poverty, hardship, destitution and suicidality. Major, evidence-informed revisions are required to improve the design and implementation of UC to prevent further adverse effects before large numbers of people move on to UC, as planned by the UK government.},

When we cannot conduct a randomized experiment, we analyze observational data. Causal inference from large observational databases (big data) can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a randomized experiment - the target experiment or target trial - that would answer the question of interest. When the goal is to guide decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit. This framework channels counterfactual theory for comparing the effects of sustained treatment strategies, organizes analytic approaches, provides a structured process for the criticism of observational studies, and helps avoid common methodologic pitfalls.},

Our discussion highlights the different ways that the DiD literature has advanced beyond the canonical model, and helps to clarify when each of the papers will be relevant for empirical work.

abstract = {Introduction The UK social security system is being transformed by the implementation of Universal Credit (UC), which combines six existing benefits and tax credits into a single payment for low-income households. Despite extensive reports of hardship associated with the introduction of UC, no previous studies have comprehensively evaluated its impact on mental health. Because payments are targeted at low-income households, impacts on mental health will have important consequences for health inequalities.

Methods and analysis We will conduct a mixed methods study. Work package (WP) 1 will compare health outcomes for new recipients of UC with outcomes for legacy benefit recipients in two large population surveys, using the phased rollout of UC as a natural experiment. We will also analyse the relationship between the proportion of UC claimants in small areas and a composite measure of mental health. WP2 will use data collected by Citizen's Advice to explore the sociodemographic and health characteristics of people who seek advice when claiming UC and identify features of the claim process that prompt advice-seeking. WP3 will conduct longitudinal in-depth interviews with up to 80 UC claimants in England and Scotland to explore reasons for claiming and experiences of the claim process. Up to 30 staff supporting claimants will also be interviewed. WP4 will use a dynamic microsimulation model to simulate the long-term health impacts of different implementation scenarios. WP5 will undertake cost–consequence analysis of the potential costs and outcomes of introducing UC and cost–benefit analyses of mitigating actions.

Ethics and dissemination We obtained ethical approval for the primary data gathering from the University of Glasgow, College of Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee, application number 400200244. We will use our networks to actively disseminate findings to UC claimants, the public, practitioners and policy-makers, using a range of methods and formats.

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007.

abstract = {The randomised trial is the preferred study design for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of interventions. Yet such trials can be prohibitively expensive, unethical, or take too long. When it is not possible to carry out a randomised trial, observational data can be used to answer similar questions. Here, we describe the process of using observational data to emulate a target trial, which applies the study design principles of randomised trials to observational studies that aim to estimate the causal effect of an intervention. The target trial provides a formal framework to help avoid self-inflicted biases common to observational studies.

Observational studies can provide evidence on the effectiveness of interventions when randomised trials are not feasible because they are expensive, unethical, or take too long. Causal inference using observational data is, however, challenging; not only are observational studies prone to confounding bias due to the lack of randomisation, but incorrect study design choices (such as the specification of the start of follow-up) can also cause self-inflicted biases.1 Such study design flaws can be overcome by first designing a hypothetical randomised trial—the target trial—that would answer the question of interest, then emulating this target trial using the available observational data and appropriate methodology.23

The first step is to specify the protocol of the trial that ideally would have been conducted, within the constraints of the available observational data. Several elements are considered at this stage245: eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, assignment procedures, outcome(s), follow-up, causal contrasts of interest (eg, {\ldots}},

(2020) ‘Effects on mental health of a UK welfare reform, Universal Credit: a longitudinal controlled study', The Lancet Public Health, 5(3), pp. e157–e164. doi: 10.1016/S2468-2667(20)30026-8.dy, we linked 197 111 observations from 52 187 individuals of working age (16–64 years) in England, Wales, and Scotland who participated in the Understanding Society UK Longitudinal Household Panel Study between 2009 and 2018 with administrative data on the month when Universal Credit was introduced into the area in which each respondent lived. We included participants who had data on employment status, local authority area of residence, psychological distress, and confounding variables. We excluded individuals from Northern Ireland and people out of work with a disability. We used difference-in-differences analysis of this nationally representative, longitudinal, household survey and separated respondents into two groups: unemployed people who were eligible for Universal Credit (intervention group) and people who were not unemployed and therefore would not have generally been eligible for Universal Credit (comparison group). Using the phased roll-out of Universal Credit, we compared the change in psychological distress (self-reported via General Health Questionnaire-12) between the intervention group and the comparison group over time as the reform was introduced in the area in which each respondent lived. We defined clinically significant psychological distress as a score of greater than 3 on the General Health Questionnaire-12. We tested whether there were differential effects across subgroups (age, sex, and education). Findings: The prevalence of psychological distress increased in the intervention group by 6{\textperiodcentered}57 percentage points (95% CI 1{\textperiodcentered}69–11{\textperiodcentered}42) after the introduction of Universal Credit relative to the comparison group, after accounting for potential confounders. We estimate that between April 29, 2013, and Dec 31, 2018, an additional 63 674 (95% CI 10 042–117 307) unemployed people will have experienced levels of psychological distress that are clinically significant due to the introduction of Universal Credit; 21 760 of these individuals might reach the diagnostic threshold for depression. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that the introduction of Universal Credit led to an increase in psychological distress, a measure of mental health difficulties, among those affected by the policy. Future changes to government welfare systems should be evaluated not only on a fiscal basis but on their potential to affect health and wellbeing.
